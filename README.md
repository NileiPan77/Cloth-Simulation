## Difficulties

Part1: air drag, deciding which points considered as one surface and calculate the air force based on that area requires careful decision and had to take edge cases into account and avoid some nodes will receive air drag more than one time.

Part2: Since "collision" is achieved by adding a pushing force within particles, it makes actual collision test and handling extra difficult with other non-water objects. It also made realistic behaviors like plunging and splashing with non water object hard to achieve.
